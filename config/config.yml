#
# Taken from:
#  First I put my config.yml file within the /config/ directory within my Rails application. It looks something like this:
#
#  development: &non_production_settings
#    :google_analytics:
#      :api_key: "[Enter Google ID]"
#    :site:
#      :title: "[Title]"
#      :address: "http://localhost:3000/"
#
#  test:
#    <<: *non_production_settings
#
#  production:
#    :google_analytics:
#      :api_key: "[Enter Google ID]"
#    :site:
#      :title: "[Title]"
#      :address: "[Address]"
#  Then, I create a new file called load_config.rb within the /config/initializers directory. You can name the file whatever you want – that’s just what I call it. This is where the actually YAML loading is going to happen – and this is what it looks like:
#
#  raw_config = File.read(RAILS_ROOT + "/config/config.yml")
#  APP_CONFIG = YAML.load(raw_config)[RAILS_ENV]
#  Now any time I want to all one of these variables I just call it like:
#
#  <%= APP_CONFIG[:site][:title] %>
